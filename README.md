This project was a part of an Assignment in a course Called Mobile Commerce - Android Development With Kotlin

The objective of this assignment is to gain experience in using the android device sensors and SQLLITE.
You are to develop an app that continuously recognizes four of the user's activities (walking, running, in vehicle and still). ( do not worry about the accuracy of your detection)
Step1: Develop the following application behavior:
1. Your application should start with a greeting to the user with the current date and time. Then immediately recognize the userâ€™s activity (walking, running, in vehicle or still).
2. Whenever an activity is recognized, an appropriate picture (your choice) is displayed and text describing the activity is displayed as well.
3. Whenever the user is running the app will play music from the device (one music track or if you want you can use a list).
4. When the user is walking display an encouraging message (or optionally, you can display a map of the current location at the top of the screen).
6.Whenever a user switches to a new activity, a message pops up displaying how long the last activity lasted. For instance, if the user was walking and became still, a toast may pop up announcing "You have just walked for 1 min, 36 seconds".
5. Create a local SQLite database to continuously store (log) the start time of each activity along with the activity (e.g., day: 12/12/2003, time 12:24, duration in mins: 30 (0 if less than a min) , Activity: walking).
An optional bonus mark:
when the user is walking or in vehicle show his/her continuous movement on the map.

Our solution does all of the above listed tasks, and was successfully accepted.
